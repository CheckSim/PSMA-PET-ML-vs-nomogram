# Predicting 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Results in Prostate Cancer Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project conducted in collaboration with the Nuclear Medicine department of Sant'Orsola Hospital in Bologna. The project aims to predict 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results in different clinical settings of biochemical relapse after radical treatment for prostate cancer, comparing the performance of machine learning algorithms with a published nomogram.

## Project Highlights

- Utilized Jupyter Notebook and Python for data analysis and machine learning implementation.
- Explored various machine learning algorithms, with a focus on Logistic Regression.
- Compared the performance of the machine learning model with a previously published nomogram.
- Highlighted the potential of machine learning as a complementary tool in medical applications.

## Conclusions

The Logistic Regression model demonstrated superior performance among the tested machine learning algorithms. Although it did not significantly outperform the previously published nomogram, the findings suggest the potential value of machine learning methods as complementary tools in the medical field. This is particularly relevant for developing explainable AI for future routine clinical applications.
